# Indexing {#sec-indexing}

This chapter is about indexes, which are the source of much confusion in Pandas and simply don't exist in Polars.

## Fetch Data

First we fetch some flight delay data. This part isn't about dataframes so feel free to skip the code.

## Read the data

:::{.callout-tip}
The examples in this book use the [lazy evaluation](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/user-guide/migration/pandas/#be-lazy)
feature of Polars less than you should.
It's just inconvenient to use the lazy API when displaying dozens of intermediate results for educational purposes.
