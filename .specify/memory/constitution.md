# Personal Static Blog Constitution

## Core Principles

### Content-First Development
All technical decisions serve content creation and reader value. Blog posts drive site architecture - never compromise writing workflow for complex features. Markdown remains the primary content format for its simplicity and portability.

### Static Site Simplicity
Maximize static generation benefits: fast loading, easy deployment, version control. Avoid dynamic features unless they provide clear value to content or readers. Prioritize maintainable, understandable code over clever optimizations.

### Reader-Centric Design
Site optimized for reading: mobile-friendly, accessible, fast-loading. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory. Content must be readable and navigable on any device. Performance metrics drive technical decisions.

### Consistent Publishing Standards
Every post follows consistent formatting, metadata, and quality standards. SEO optimization built into publishing workflow. Content reviewed for clarity and accuracy before publication. Categories and tags used systematically.

### Sustainable Evolution
Regular maintenance prevents technical debt accumulation. Dependencies updated quarterly, broken links fixed immediately. Platform changes evaluated for impact on existing content. Blog remains functional and accessible over time.

## Technical Standards

Quarto for content management, GitHub Pages for hosting. Posts in Markdown with frontmatter. Images optimized, links validated. RSS feed and social sharing enabled.

## Content Workflow

Topics span personal interests without artificial constraints. Posts categorized and tagged consistently. Comments and analytics integrated but not required. Drafts reviewed before publication.

## Governance

Constitution guides all content and technical decisions. Updates require review for impact on existing content. Major platform changes documented and tested. Constitution evolves with blog growth while maintaining core principles.
