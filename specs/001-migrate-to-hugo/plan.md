# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Hugo static site generator (latest stable)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Hugo core, no additional plugins or themes  
**Storage**: Filesystem (Markdown files, images, static assets)  
**Testing**: Manual visual testing and link validation  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers, hosted on GitHub Pages
**Project Type**: Static site generation  
**Performance Goals**: Site load under 2 seconds, build under 5 minutes  
**Constraints**: Minimal dependencies, no external plugins, maintain existing content structure  
**Scale/Scope**: Personal blog with ~10 pages, images, and navigation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Content-First**: Does this feature primarily serve content creation or reader value? Yes - migrates content to new platform while maintaining creation workflow.
- **Static Simplicity**: Does this maintain static site benefits (fast loading, easy deployment)? Yes - Hugo generates static sites, easy deployment to GitHub Pages.
- **Reader-Centric**: Does this improve reading experience (mobile-friendly, accessible, fast)? Yes - adds dark mode toggle for user preference, maintains accessibility.
- **Publishing Standards**: Does this follow consistent formatting and quality standards? Yes - preserves content structure and metadata.
- **Sustainable Evolution**: Does this prevent technical debt and support long-term maintenance? Yes - minimal dependencies reduce maintenance burden.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
