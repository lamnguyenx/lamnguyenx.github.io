# Live Coding: Implementing Timeout Features in BAML

## Section 1: Introduction to Live Coding and BAML

## Stream Setup and Welcome

The live coding session begins with technical setup to ensure viewers can join the stream properly. The hosts express excitement about this long-awaited episode focused on practical AI coding workflows.

## Series Context: "AI that Works"

This session is part of the regular "AI that Works" Tuesday series, which showcases real-world shipping workflows that effectively leverage AI. The series demonstrates:

- Building AI-powered pipelines
- Methodologies for pipeline construction
- Practical mechanisms for AI integration

## Host Introductions

**Fibof**: Works on BAML (a programming language for LLMs and AI agents)
**Dex**: Works on human layer and coding workflows

## The Challenge: BAML Timeout Feature

### Problem Statement

The team is tackling a long-standing issue in BAML: implementing timeout configuration capabilities. Users have been requesting the ability to configure:

- Connection timeouts
- Response timeouts
- Total timeouts
- Timeouts within fallback and retry policies

### Background and History

- **GitHub Issue Created**: March 18th (initial proposal)
- **Previous Attempts**:
  - Assigned to an engineer who attempted implementation
  - Tried using a coding agent (which failed)
  - The problem involves complex nesting requirements to avoid verbose syntax

### Current State

Dex has minimal familiarity with the BAML codebase, creating an ideal test case for demonstrating how coding agents can tackle complex problems in unfamiliar codebases. The hosts plan to:

1. Start from the GitHub issue specification
2. Review existing documentation
3. Build the timeout feature from scratch using AI assistance

## Technical Context

BAML enables users to configure LLMs with various policies and mechanisms. The timeout feature needs to integrate seamlessly with existing retry policies and fallback mechanisms, requiring careful architectural consideration.

## Session Goals

This live coding session aims to demonstrate:

- How coding agents can solve hard problems in maintainable ways
- The transition from concept to working implementation
- Practical AI-assisted development workflows
- Building complex features in unfamiliar codebases
