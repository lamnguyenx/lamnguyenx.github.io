## History
### Intern
**2019.02 - 2019.06**
**Project:** On-device KaldiASR.
- **Description:** VietMAP approached us with a unique challenge: developing an offline, on-device ASR solution. At the time, all our models were built using KaldiASR, the state-of-the-art C++-based speech recognition framework. However, no open-source projects existed for running Kaldi on Android devices. This presented us with a significant engineering challenge: making Kaldi work on the Android platform.
- **Technologies:** Docker, Android NDK, C++, Shell, KaldiASR, GStreamer
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Conducted deep dive into KaldiASR ecosystem architecture and implementation
  - Learned GStreamer framework and Android NDK for cross-platform development
  - Ported online GStreamer-based Kaldi implementation from x86 to Android ARM architecture. Integrated this implemenation with GStreamer Android demo application to achieve real-time voice recognition.
  - This porject is archived when client pivoted to alternative solutions (including Google APIs integration).
