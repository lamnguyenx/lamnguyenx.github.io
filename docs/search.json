If you have some familiarity with any dataframe library, most of the examples should make sense, but if you’re familiar with Pandas they’ll make even more sense because all the Polars code is accompanied by the equivalent Pandas code.\nYou don’t need to have read Modern Pandas, though I of course think it’s a great read.",
